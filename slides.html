        Much like JavaScript!

        It reads code from top to bottom, just like JavaScript <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        It can include external libraries, just like JavaScript <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        It's got variables, functions, loops and ifs, just like JavaScript <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        # Some syntax to kick things off

        JavaScript structures work with { } and ( ) and ; to define their structures <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        Python works with : and              <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        That's right. White space. Lots and lots of white space. Python is the land of meaningful white space. The white space is part of the code and you will learn to love it. Which means it can't be minified. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        # Variables
        
        The concepts of global and local variables still apply. 

        But gone is the "var" keyword and instead we have ... nothing. 

        ```python
        myVariable = "Hello!"
        ```

        Which you can console.log() with the simple "print" statement


        ```python
        myVariable = "Hello!"

        print myVariable

        ```
        Go ahead and give it a shot. 


      </script>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-toc data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Loops

        Same as JavaScript, there are FOR loops and WHILE loops. 

        But we get rid of the (CONDITION) structure. Instead: 


        ```python
        initialNumber = 0

        while initialNumber < 10:
          print initialNumber
          initialNumber = initialNumber + 1
        ```

        Notice the tabs. That tab in is the meaningful white space that makes Python special. The tab indicates what is inside any function, be it a function, if statement, loop or namespace. Tabs define everything, which forces you to maintain a good readable structure in your code. 
        
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-toc data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Loops
        
        Same as JavaScript, you can make arrays. But in Python they're called Lists. They look like you would expect. 

        ```python
        myList = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3']
        ```

        Then you can use a FOR loop to iterate through it. 

        ```python
        for every_item in myList:
          print every_item
        ```
        
        In this case, Python assigns the iterative list item to the variable you establish. Every_item could be any variable name you assign. 

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # IF statements

        Just like JavaScript, we have conditionals. They come in two forms: 

        ```python
        initialNumber = 5

        if initialNumber < 5:
          print initialNumber
        else:
          print "nope"
        ```

        Or, you can Try/Except

        ```python
        myName = "William"

        try: 
          print myLastName
        except:
          print "Yeah, you don't have that variable yet"
        ```
        
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Functions

        Just like JavaScript, Python has functions, too. But we don't use the "function()" keyword, we use "def" like so: 

        ```python
        def myPythonFunction(anArgument, secondArgument):
          print anArgument
          thirdVariable = anArgument + secondArgument
          print thirdVariable
        ```
        
        And just as you're used to, you call them with the function name, and you can pass variables into them. 

        ```python
        initialNumber = 5
        myFirstname = "William"

        myPythonFunction(initialNumber, myFirstName)
        ```

        # External libraries

        Just like JavaScript libraries like jQuery and D3, there are thousands of Python libraries that allow us to take advantage of the expertise of other developers. These are called "Packages" and they're super easy to use. 

      </script>

        # External libraries

        This is how we use an external library to that handles time. It tells our program what dates are, what seconds are and how to handle them. 

        ```python

        import time
        
        ```

        That's it. The "import" command and the library name. No links, no folders, nothing. You just import it.

        # Installing PIP

        1. Download get-pip.py <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        2. Move the file to the computer system you want to run it on (this is likely your local machine, but you can also move it to your BlueHost or a Raspberry Pi or any other system that can run Python) <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        3. Open your terminal and navigate to that directory <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        4. Run the file: <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        ```terminal
        $ python get-pip.py
        ```
        5. That's it! You have PIP installed <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        # Working with PIP

        There are more than 80,000 packages currently available in the PIP library. They range from JSON managers, to URL openers right up to high end scientific analysis packages and encryption suites. 

        <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">Here's a good list of packages you have to work with.</a>

        From the machine you want to install the package on, type this into your terminal 

        ```terminal
        $ pip install python-geoip
        ```

        python-geoip is a neat little tool that lets you find where an IP address is in the world.

        # Some notes on PIP

        The same rules for jQuery extensions apply: 
        <ul>
          <li>Good libraries have good documentation.</li>
          <li>Anyone can build one. The community decides what's good and what's bad.</li>
          <li>Complicated libraries can feel like a black box, difficult to understand but very useful.</li>
        </ul>

        If you're ever curious how many packages are installed on your machine, you can run this command to see them all. 

        ```terminal
        $ pip freeze
        ```

        To update any packages, use the --update flag on a pip command: 

        ```terminal 
        $ pip install python-geoip --update
        ```

        # myFirstProject.py

        Same as any project, set it up in its own folder so you can keep track of all the files you need. 

        The file extension for Python files is .py. 

        You can run any Python program through the terminal by navigating to the directory and typing: 

        ```terminal
        $ python filename.py
        ```

        print mySiteHTML
        ```

        The dot notation system we're familiar with comes into play here, and you can follow the chain of methods.

        <ul>
          <li>Open URLLIB package</li>
          <li>Open a URL: myWebSite is the URL to open (returns a file object: index.html)</li>

        It's good at social engagement. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->
        
        Most clients will want some Twitter presence to post menu items, specials, promotions and other predictable content that they don't have to always schedule themselves. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        # Posting to Twitter via the API

        Twitter lets you use an API to post to your account without having to go through the LOGIN WITH TWITTER nonsense every time. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        You just need an API key and an account token. Let's take care of the account token first. <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        Go to <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens">dev.twitter.com</a> <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      # Posting to Twitter via the API
      
      Once you're logged in, go to <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/">apps.twitter.com</a> and register yourself a new app. 

      Get yourself an API key (public and private)

      Generate yourself an access token (public and private)

      The access token is essentially your login and password for your twitter account. Do not share it, do not post it anywhere publicly and do not let anyone copy it.

    <section class="slide small-type" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # Posting to Twitter via the API
      
      Once you have your keys and access tokens, it's time to let Python works its magic. 

      (First let's fix one bug that I know is just around the corner: Fix the encryption issue that is still a bug in some versions of Python by running this in your console):

      ```terminal
      $ pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1
      $ pip install --upgrade ndg-httpsclient
      ```

      NOW ON TO TWITTER!!!

    <section class="slide small-type" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # Posting to Twitter via the API
      
      It is technically possible to go through all of these processes without a black box to help us out. 

      But..........

      There's a package for that! 

      ```terminal 
      $ pip install tweepy
      ```
      
      Install Tweepy and it will handle much of the request formatting and the setup of posting methods so we can get on with the fun part.

    <section class="slide small-type" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # OK - let's bring it all together
      
      We have Tweepy, now we have to import it. 

      ```python
      import tweepy
      import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
      urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()
      ```

      You can also use dot notation in import statements if you only need to import part of a package. It can save you more complex operations later in your program. 

      That last line is about correcting that encryption issue we addressed earlier (in all honesty: That's me copying from StackOverflow)

    <section class="slide small-type" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # Bringing it all together
      
      There's also a commenting character in Python. We use the "#" to signify a commented out line of code. Very useful. 

      So we can now add our API keys to our code, storying them in their own variables. 

      ```python
      # Establish Twitter authorization.
      # Need to sign up for API key at apps.twitter.com

      TWEEPY_CONSUMER_KEY = #'YOUR_API_KEY'
      TWEEPY_CONSUMER_SECRET = #'YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY'
      TWEEPY_ACCESS_TOKEN = #'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
      TWEEPY_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = #'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN'
      ```

      I'm using all caps here. You can use whatever your heart desires. These are just variable names.
      
    </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide small-type" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # Bringing it all together
      
      The first thing we have to do is initialize the app: Connect it to our account, with our API key and our access token. This will make sure that we actually have all the permissions in place to post to this account. 

      ```python
      # Setup authorizations with tweepy
      auth1 = tweepy.auth.OAuthHandler(TWEEPY_CONSUMER_KEY, TWEEPY_CONSUMER_SECRET)
      auth1.set_access_token(TWEEPY_ACCESS_TOKEN, TWEEPY_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
      api = tweepy.API(auth1)
      ```

      I'm using all caps here. You can use whatever your heart desires. These are just variable names.

  </section>

    <section class="slide small-type" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # Bringing it all together
      
      Now we can set up a function that will actually use that authorization. We have the variable "api" available to us now, which is a fully authorize and ready-to-go Twitter application just waiting for our commands. 

      ```python
      def tweetit(statusUpdate):
          api.update_status(status=statusupdate)
          print statusupdate

      ```

      Notice the "def" keyword, the colon and the tabs that make this a function. 
      
    </script>
  </section>

    <section class="slide small-type" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
      # Bringing it all together
      
      Now we just have give ourselves a status update and call the function! 

      ```python
      statusupdate = "This is a HackerYou side project session, testing a Tweet from our own Python bot!"
      tweetit(statusUpdate)
      ```

      Now go check your Twitter account!

      # Congratulations!
      
      There are a pile of ways to control how this works. Look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sched.html">Event Scheduler</a> module in Python if you want to post at regular times. You can also look at the time.sleep() method to simply wait a given amount of time between your posts. 

      You can use lists [ ] to set up messages to Tweet or you can even draw from a spreadsheet with the very powerful <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html">CSV module</a>.

      The world is now your oyster. Have fun learning how to manipulate the webs!
